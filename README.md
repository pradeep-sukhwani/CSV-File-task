# CSV-File-task
### Here I have .txt file which is comma separated file (.csv) which contains some data of customers such Date, Phone, Name, Amount, So I have to get the data from that file as per these questions:
#### 1. How many orders did the site receive?
#### 2. What was the total amount of the orders?
#### 3. List the names of the customers who ordered once and did not order again.
#### 4. Get a distribution of customers who ordered exactly once, exactly twice and so on up to 4 orders and group the rest as 5 orders and above.
